# La-Liga-Fantasy-Game
A simulation website created from TypeScript and React, that gives users a 100M budget to buy available players, just like the world-renowned Fantasy Premier League. 
The rule of the game is simple, you can choose as many players that you want, as long as the price does not go up 100M. Players featured are selected from multiple La Liga teams with in-game price depending how good they are in real life. 
I used Tailwind CSS for UI to enhance visualization and added gradients for a better layout. Vite is used as a trustworthy dev server which runs the app quickly for production. 
To run the app, write these commands: 
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
